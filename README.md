# Hello Webpack

Development environment that preprocesses styles, bundles scripts, watches for file changes, and uses live reload all with Webpack and Webpack Dev Server

### Getting Started

Start by cloning this repo, then run

```
cd hello-webpack
```

then run

```
npm install
```

And run gulp's default task

```
gulp
```

You will see 'Hello Webpack' open at localhost:3000

## Live Reload

As you change files in the `src` folder, you will see changes reflected in the browser.

### New Files
When adding new files, restart your server so that the new files will be watched

## Using a Proxy

To add a proxy to browser sync, first create the proxy on your local machine. Next replace the `server` property with the `proxy` property and define your proxy.

```
let localhost = 'hello-webpack.localhost';

browserSync.init({
    proxy: localhost,
    // server: {
    //     baseDir: './'
    // }
});
```
