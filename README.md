# Hello Webpack

This is a development environment that uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to generate html, bundle preprocessed scripts / styles, and watch them with [Webpack Dev Server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) hot reload.

This also contains a production environment that minifies JS and uses Extract Text Webpack Plugin to generate minified CSS.

Other core tools included are [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/), and [ESLint.](https://eslint.org/)
